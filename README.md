# Introduction to Deep Learning (TensorFlow)
## Assignment 1: Let the Tensors Flow
This is an assignment to build a deep model of a Multi Layer Perceptron on MNIST Dataset.

## Assignment 2 : Let the Tensors Board? & also tf.data
- An MLP training script using tf.data.
- A description of what the six shuffle/batch/repeat orderings do (on a conceptual level) and which one you think is the most sensible for training neural networks.
- For each “failed” script above, a description of the problem as well as how to fix it (there may be multiple ways). You can just write some text here (markdown cells!), but feel free to reinforce your ideas with some code snippets.

## Assignment 3 : Keras & CNNs
- A CNN (built with Keras) trained on MNIST (or not, see below). Also using Keras losses, optimizers and metrics, but do still use a “custom” training loop (with GradientTape).
- Sanity check using MNIST and further moved to CIFAR dataset.

## Assignment 4 : Graphs & DenseNets
Basic implementation of DenseNet

## Assignment 5: Text Classification with RNNs (Part 1)
Low level implementation of RNNs

## Assignment 6: Text Classification with RNNs (Part 2)
Different RNN models - LSTMs, SimpleRNN, GRU
